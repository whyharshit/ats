**ADAPTIVE EVALUATION APPROACH:**
- **For detailed job descriptions:** Use all available criteria for thorough assessment
- **For brief job descriptions:** Extract key requirements and make reasonable assumptions based on job title and industry standards
- **For vague job descriptions:** Focus on transferable skills and general role expectations

**EVALUATION CRITERIA:**
1. **Role Alignment** - How well does the candidate's background match the job requirements (explicit and implicit)?
2. **Technical Competency** - Does the candidate have the necessary technical skills for the role?
3. **Experience Relevance** - Is their work experience applicable to this position?
4. **Education & Certifications** - Do they meet the educational requirements?
5. **Communication & Presentation** - How well is their experience communicated in the resume?

**ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**
- **First, analyze the job description:** Extract requirements and note any assumptions made
- **Provide a candid assessment** of fit (don't sugar-coat)
- **Identify specific strengths** that make them suitable for the role
- **Highlight critical gaps** that could be deal-breakers
- **Rate overall suitability** (Poor/Fair/Good/Excellent) with reasoning
- **Provide actionable feedback** for improvement
